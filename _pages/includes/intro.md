Hello there! I'm Liding Zhang (å¼ ç«‹é¼Ž), and currently at the Chair of [Robotics, Artificial Intelligence and Real-Time Systems (AIR)](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/air/home/) at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), under the supervision of [Prof. Alois Knoll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alois_Christian_Knoll), specializing in robotics and artificial intelligence. My research centers on sampling-based almost-surely asymptotically optimal (a.s.a.o) motion planning, high-DOF multi-robot manipulation and collaboration, coordinated control of mobile robot fleets, and related areas in advanced robotics. I have published 30+ papers in leading robotic journals such as [IEEE T-Mech](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=3516), [IEEE T-ASE](https://www.ieee-ras.org/publications/t-ase), [IEEE RA-L](https://www.ieee-ras.org/publications/ra-l), and have presented at robotic flagship conferences including [ICRA](https://www.ieee-ras.org/conferences-workshops/fully-sponsored/icra) and [IROS](https://www.ieee-ras.org/conferences-workshops/financially-co-sponsored/iros).

Beyond academia, I gained industry experience as an NVH Assistant Engineer at Volkswagen Automatic Transmission (Tianjin) Co. Ltd. and contributed to EU-wide, DE-national, and state-funded projects in Germany, such as BMBFâ€™s [6G-life](https://6g-life.de/), the [DARKO Project](https://darko-project.eu/), and the Bavarian [KI.FABRIK](https://www.mec.ed.tum.de/lfe/forschung/projekte/kifabrik/) initiative. Outside of research, I enjoy music ðŸŽºðŸŽ¸ðŸŽ¹ and was awarded First Prize in the National Trumpet Competition in China.

<!-- I am proficient in C++, Python, ROS1/2, OMPL and a broad range of robotics development tools, and I actively serve as a reviewer for major robotics conferences and journals.  -->
